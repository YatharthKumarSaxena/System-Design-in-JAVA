## 🧑‍💻 **Problem Statement** 🧑‍💻

> **Design a system for a fictional online shopping platform called "ShopWorld".**

The system will include the management of:
- 📋 **Product Listings**
- 👥 **User Accounts**
- 🛍️ **Order Processing**

This system ensures a seamless shopping experience for users, while keeping the code **clean, maintainable, and scalable** using **LLD and SOLID principles**.

## 🛠️ **Core Modules of ShopWorld** 🛠️

> Below is a breakdown of the core components of the **ShopWorld** system:

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **1. User Management**

🔹 **Account Creation** — Users can create accounts with unique usernames and passwords 🔑  
🔹 **Authentication & Authorization** — Users must log in with their credentials to access platform features 🔐

---

### 📦 **2. Product Management**

🔹 **Category-based Products** — Products are classified into categories like **Electronics, Clothing, Groceries**, etc.  
🔹 **Add New Products** — Admins can add new products dynamically to the platform ✨

---

### 🛍️ **3. Order Processing**

🔹 **Add to Cart** — Users can add products to their shopping cart 🛒

# Why Creational Design Pattern
The reason is simple that to solve the real world problems we have something called objects in programming that help
 us to represent the real world problems in the world of programming so whenever we are dealing with a real world project ,
at the core of any project , it's all about the object creation , so if object creation is not done without prper planning 
then you might found that you have created object something that is not in the desired phase or unwanted because sometimes we 
need to create many complex objects , there might be many parameters in the object , so for a good software engineer 
he/ she must have to plan about object creation because objects are the heart and the soul , they are the brain that will do all the activities
in the world of programming, so in order to help you out of the object creation , the ppeople who have mastered in the object oriented
programming world , you learn from our experience , in task of building many projects they have done many mistakes and from that they brought some conclusion 
, so they gave few examples of implenetations or patternsthat we should be aware in creating the object , and that tipivally is called as the creational design pattern
this help them achieve a better project , a scalable project , aproject that which is more loosely coupled wgich follows the pen closed principles of SOLID
