# I am the README.md file of this folder to assist you 
In our project one of our requirement is that you know I should be able to store the user information now I have to store the user information I need to use some kind of user database now I have to go and define a class called as user database and
using this class I need to go and create the objects in any application if we are going to create an instance or object of a database say user database. can I have the multiple instances or should have only one single instance ??Now if I am going to create multiple instances in the application of this user database then the challenges can be :- entire project you have created the instances of the user 
databases from the multiple places now the same application is using the multiple instances of the user database it might happen at the changes done by one user is not to being reflected to the another user it might lead to the inconsistent state so normally the data should have a single source of truth No 2 people if they are looking into data they should see the same data otherwise 
it might need to the inconsistent state so normally this instance you know in the entire application the database instance should be always singles so whenever you have such kind of requirement where in your application you want some objects to be created only once you do not allow it to be created more than once anytime
please where you go and make use of the singleton design pattern PU other cases may be like to say for example you want to do the login now for the entire application you definitely want that all the locks all the important event that has happened should go and get stored in a single file it should not happen on multiple files otherwise in that case you will not be able to manage you will not be able to
read so again whenever you are doing login you will realise that you are using a singleton design pattern there you are making sure that you are using only one instance or the objective pair enough if I give you a realistic example are real world 
example to give you a sense that where it makes sense of let's say for example you have a library and in the library let's say that it is the library of your college and different departments let's say the department one department
two department three department force now let's say that if each of the department there is a central library but each of the department is maintaining their own catalogue of books write so 
even in maintaining catalogue maintaining catalogue C2 d3 maintaining catalogue C3 maintaining catalist C for write so now what happens is that you know all the people from this department is looking into this catalogue all the people from the another department is looking into this catalogue so other people are looking from this catalogue let's say that at any moment of time some books are changed books are 
changed and even department which is computer science edit few more books of computers in the library so now this D1 will let's let you know the different number of books then due to d3 D4 if you have to ensure that when every time a new book has been added by one specific department in the library all of the department also has to be updated so what 
could have been a better solution a better solution is that instead of having a separate catalogue for all the department the library should have a single catalogue c and all the people should follow the same catalogue because in that case it will insure that this catalogue is all the time updated it has the latest and the greatest data this is what we are trying to achieve with the help of 
singleton design pattern it helps you to create object in such a way that in the entire the project only a single instance of the object is created so for example in this case if I make use of the singleton design pattern what will happen I will go and define usual database and it will have a method get instance will create only so no matter how many times I go and call this method how many times I go 
and call this matter this is one this is another time both same as you just DB2 because they are the same objects or instances but how do we do it let's try to see in action so let me go back directly
