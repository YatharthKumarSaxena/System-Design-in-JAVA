## üìò **Folder Insights** üìò
- üì¶ **Factory Design Pattern Implementation**:  
  This folder demonstrates the implementation of the **Factory Design Pattern**.

- üîå **Interface Implementation**:  
  All class files (except **ProductFactory.java**) implement the **Product.java Interface**.

- üè≠ **Factory Class**:  
  **ProductFactory.java** implements the Factory Design Pattern, handling the creation of various product objects (Clothing, Electronics, Groceries, etc.).

## üß† **Why Factory Design Pattern?** üß†

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The Need for Object Creation**
As per the problem statement, we need to create various **products** for an online shopping website. The products can be of different types such as:
- **üõí Groceries**
- **üì± Electronics**
- **üëï Clothing**

With the expansion of the online shopping platform, there could be more product categories added in the future.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The Problem with Direct Object Creation**
When working with simple programs, creating objects directly using constructors is fine. However, as the application grows, this approach becomes inefficient and unmanageable.

#### **The Problem**
1. **Multiple Object Types**: Each product (like Groceries, Electronics, and Clothing) has its own logic for object creation.
2. **Messy Main Class**: If we keep calling constructors directly in the main program, the logic of **object creation** is forced inside the main class.
3. **Tight Coupling**: The logic of object creation is embedded in the main class. If the product creation logic changes, we will have to modify the main program.
4. **Violation of SOLID Principles**: This approach violates the **Open-Closed Principle** from the **SOLID Design Principles**. The principle states that our code should be:
    - **Open for Extension** (We can add new product types)
    - **Closed for Modification** (We should not modify existing code)

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Why Factory Design Pattern is the Solution**
To solve the above problems, we use the **Factory Design Pattern**, which allows us to **decouple** the product creation logic from the main class.

#### **How it Solves the Problem**
1. **Centralized Object Creation**: The **ProductFactory.java** class is responsible for creating product objects, so the main class does not need to worry about how the objects are created.
2. **Dynamic Object Creation**: The factory takes an input (like "grocery" or "clothing") and returns the corresponding object.
3. **Adheres to SOLID Principles**: If we want to add new product types (like Furniture), we only need to modify the **factory class**, not the main class. This keeps the main class **closed for modification** but **open for extension**.
4. **Increased Scalability**: This approach supports the addition of new product types easily, making the codebase more scalable.

---

## üì¢ **Final Takeaway** üì¢
The **Factory Design Pattern** is a powerful way to handle object creation in enterprise-level applications. It ensures that the logic for creating objects is **centralized**, **flexible**, and **scalable**. By decoupling object creation from the main class, it adheres to the **Open-Closed Principle** of the **SOLID Design Principles**.

With the Factory Design Pattern, you can create new product types (like Furniture or Stationery) without modifying existing classes, keeping your code clean, maintainable, and future-proof.

This concludes the README for the **Entities** folder. **Happy Coding!** üöÄ
