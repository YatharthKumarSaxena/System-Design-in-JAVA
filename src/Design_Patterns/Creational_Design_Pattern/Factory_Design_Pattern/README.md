## 🧠 **What is Factory Design Pattern?**
The **Factory Design Pattern** is one of the most popular **Creational Design Patterns**. It provides a way to create objects without exposing the logic of instantiation to the client. Instead, it relies on a "factory method" that creates objects based on input conditions.

---

## 🧩 **Key Concepts of Factory Design Pattern**
- **🏭 Factory**: Responsible for creating objects.
- **📦 Product**: The objects that are being created.
- **🤖 Client**: The system or user that requests objects from the factory.

---

## 💡 **How Does It Work?**
1. **Client Request**: The client requests an object but does not know how it is created.
2. **Factory Decision**: The factory decides **which object** to instantiate and returns it to the client.
3. **Client Use**: The client uses the returned object without worrying about its creation process.

---

## 📘 **Where is it Used in the Problem Statement?**
The **Factory Design Pattern** is used to manage complex objects like **Orders** and **User Accounts**. Here’s how it's implemented in this context:

- **🛠️ Complex Object Creation**: Orders and User Accounts may have many mandatory and optional attributes, making the object creation process difficult using simple constructors.
- **🎨 Customization**: Different types of orders, like **South Indian Meal** or **North Indian Meal**, require varying item lists, which makes them dynamic in nature.
- **🚀 Simple Object Creation Process**: Instead of using **constructors** with multiple parameters, the **Factory Design Pattern** creates and customizes objects efficiently.

---

## 📢 **Final Takeaway**
The **Factory Design Pattern** offers a clean and maintainable way to create complex objects. It abstracts the creation process, allowing for flexibility, modularity, and simplicity. When you need to create multiple objects with similar logic but different configurations, consider using the Factory Pattern to reduce complexity and improve readability.

This concludes the README for the **Factory_Design_Pattern** folder. **Happy Coding!** 🚀
