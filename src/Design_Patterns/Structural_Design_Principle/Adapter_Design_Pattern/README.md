# Welcome to the Adapter_Design_Pattern folder
# Hello EveryOne , I am the README file of this folder to assist you
<h1>This folder consist of total 6 files</h1>
<h2>1.Total 4 files are of class files given below:- </h2>
<h3>1. Audio file (class file)</h3>
<h3>2. Image file (class file)</h3>
<h3>3. Image_Adapter file (class file)</h3>
<h3>4. Video file (class file)</h3>
<h2>2. One file is an interface file that implement all class files except image file</h2>
<h3>5. This interface file is Media file</h3>
<h2> Last file is the README file of this folder which you are currently Reading</h2>
<h3>6. Last file is README.md file that you are reading</h3>
<h1>Insights of this folder</h1>
<h2>This folder covers one of the most used structural design pattern i.e adapter design pattern </h2>
<h2>Define Adapter Design Pattern Jarvis in your language(My AI BOT)</h2>
<h1> Where have we used Adapter Design Pattern while solving the problem :- </h1>
<h2>I have to go and play a media player right and typically I can go and say that this media player 
should have a play method should have a play method we should play the different types of media now if 
we are going to talk about the different types of media we have write the differences types of the media
we have a video audio image now if we try to see here both video and audio they are some how similar to 
play write but this image is slightly different but my expectation is that my media player should be able
to play any kind of media so it be audio video or be it image the same method I should be able to achieve
here that is play method to different types of entity so whenever a situation happens when you have to
entities say entity 1 and entity 2 and if both of them are not compatible and I still have to make 
sure both of them work together we use a design pattern in that case called as earn adaptor design
pattern now let us try to understand an example of adaptor, an adaptor in real life when do use it
let it say that I have a pen which is 3 pin 3 pin plug write and then let's say that I have a two 
pin socket now if I have to used 3 pin plug in a socket which can allow only two pencil now if I have
to use three pin plug in a socket which can allow only two pins that what I will have to do I will have
to use you make some kind of special thing called as adaptor so that adaptor can take 3 pin input and
then it give two output which could be connected to a socket with the two pins of the socket similar 
concept similarly we will have to will have to make work the image entity with the video and d audio 
entity and I believe here adaptor design pattern should be used so when we write code we will see 
that how that happens that is one observation which will write implement in this folder as per our 
problem statement</h2>
