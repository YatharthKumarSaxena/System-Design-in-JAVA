## 📘 **Overview of Structural Design Patterns**

**Structural Design Patterns** focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.  
They help create efficient, flexible, and scalable systems.

## 🚀 **Why Use Structural Design Patterns?**

| 🟢 **Benefits**             | 🟢 **Explanation**                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 🎥 **Multimedia Support**   | Used in apps like **YouTube**, **Netflix**, etc.   |
| 🔄 **Adaptable Code**       | Supports multiple file formats.                   |
| 🧩 **Object Composition**    | Combines smaller objects into larger structures.  |
| 🛠️ **Simplified Development**| Reduces development complexity.                  |
| 📈 **Scalable Code**         | Makes code easy to upgrade or extend.             |
| ⚡ **Flexible & Efficient**  | Code is modular, efficient, and clean.            |

## 🧩 **Folder Details**

This folder contains implementations of **3 major Structural Design Patterns**:

### 📂 **1. Adapter Design Pattern**
> **Purpose:** Connects incompatible interfaces to work together.  
> 📘 **Example:** Enables different media formats (MP4, MP3, JPEG) to play using a **single player**.

### 📂 **2. Composite Design Pattern**
> **Purpose:** Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
> 📘 **Example:** A **Media Library** containing subfolders (Videos, Audios, Images) as nodes in a tree structure.

### 📂 **3. Decorator Design Pattern**
> **Purpose:** Dynamically adds new functionalities to an object at runtime.  
> 📘 **Example:** Adds filters, effects, or enhancements (like **video filters** or **audio effects**) to multimedia files.

> 📌 **Explore each folder for more details and examples.**

## 📚 **Problem Statement**

🎯 **Objective:**  
We are building a **Multimedia Streaming Application** that supports the following:  
🎥 **Videos** | 🎵 **Audio Tracks** | 🖼️ **Images**

> **Key Challenges to Solve:**
- 📂 Support multiple media formats.
- ⚙️ Efficiently organize media into hierarchical structures.
- 🚀 Enable smooth playback for users.
- 🔄 Allow real-time modifications like **filters** and **effects**.

---

## 💡 **How Do We Solve It?**

We use **3 Structural Design Patterns** to address these challenges:

- 📂 **Adapter Design Pattern** — Converts different media formats (MP4, MP3, PNG) into a standard playable format.
- 🌲 **Composite Design Pattern** — Organizes files in a hierarchical tree-like structure (like folders and subfolders).
- ✨ **Decorator Design Pattern** — Applies filters and effects to audio, video, or images at runtime.
