## 📂 **Folder Structure**

This folder consists of a total of **5 items**. Below is the detailed structure of the folder and its files:

### 📘 **Folders (3)**
1️⃣ **Adapter_Design_Pattern** — Contains the implementation of the Adapter Design Pattern.  
2️⃣ **Composite_Design_Pattern** — Contains the implementation of the Composite Design Pattern.  
3️⃣ **Decorator_Design_Pattern** — Contains the implementation of the Decorator Design Pattern.

### 📘 **Class File (1)**
4️⃣ **MultiMedia_App.java** — Integrates all the design patterns (Adapter, Composite, Decorator) into a single multimedia application.

### 📘 **README Files (1)**
5️⃣ **README.md** — The file you are currently reading, which explains the folder's structure and purpose.

> **📝 Note:**  
> Each folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed information about the respective design pattern.

## 📘 **Overview of Structural Design Patterns**

**Structural Design Patterns** focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.  
They aim to simplify the design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between entities.
If we make use of all kind of design patterns in structural design pattern that is composite design pattern,
decorator design pattern and adaptor design pattern then it will help us to build a moral scalable, robust
and flexible design.

### **Common Goals:**
- Improve **flexibility** and **scalability** of software systems.
- Enable **modularity** and **reusability** of code.
- Help in building complex systems with easier integration.

## 🚀 **Why Use Structural Design Patterns?**

| 🟢 **Benefits**             | 🟢 **Explanation**                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 🎥 **Multimedia Support**   | Used in apps like **YouTube**, **Netflix**, etc.   |
| 🔄 **Adaptable Code**       | Supports multiple file formats seamlessly.       |
| 🧩 **Object Composition**    | Combines smaller objects into larger structures.  |
| 🛠️ **Simplified Development**| Reduces development complexity.                  |
| 📈 **Scalable Code**         | Makes code easy to upgrade or extend.             |
| ⚡ **Flexible & Efficient**  | Code is modular, efficient, and clean.            |

## 🧩 **Folder Details**

This folder contains implementations of **3 major Structural Design Patterns**:

### 📂 [**1. Adapter Design Pattern**](#-adapter-design-pattern)
> **Purpose:** Connects incompatible interfaces to work together.  
> 📘 **Example:** Enables different media formats (MP4, MP3, JPEG) to play using a **single player**.

### 📂 [**2. Composite Design Pattern**](#-composite-design-pattern)
> **Purpose:** Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
> 📘 **Example:** A **Media Library** containing subfolders (Videos, Audios, Images) as nodes in a tree structure.

### 📂 [**3. Decorator Design Pattern**](#-decorator-design-pattern)
> **Purpose:** Dynamically adds new functionalities to an object at runtime.  
> 📘 **Example:** Adds filters, effects, or enhancements (like **video filters** or **audio effects**) to multimedia files.

> 📌 **Explore each folder for more details and examples.**

## 📚 **Problem Statement**

🎯 **Objective:**  
We are building a **Multimedia Streaming Application** that supports the following:  
🎥 **Videos** | 🎵 **Audio Tracks** | 🖼️ **Images**

> **Key Challenges to Solve:**
- 📂 Support multiple media formats.
- ⚙️ Efficiently organize media into hierarchical structures.
- 🚀 Enable smooth playback for users.
- 🔄 Allow real-time modifications like **filters** and **effects**.

---

## 💡 **How Do We Solve It?**

We use **3 Structural Design Patterns** to address these challenges:

1️⃣ **[Adapter Design Pattern](#-adapter-design-pattern)**
- Converts different media formats (MP4, MP3, PNG) into a standard playable format.
- Ensures that incompatible media formats work with the same player interface.

2️⃣ **[Composite Design Pattern](#-composite-design-pattern)**
- Organizes files in a hierarchical tree-like structure (like folders and subfolders).
- Allows the management of media files (videos, audio, images) as a unified collection.

3️⃣ **[Decorator Design Pattern](#-decorator-design-pattern)**
- Applies filters and effects to audio, video, or images at runtime.
- Enhances media quality dynamically without changing the core media classes.

## 🎉 **Congratulations!**

You now understand the purpose and structure of the **Structural_Design_Pattern** folder.  
By applying **Adapter**, **Composite**, and **Decorator** patterns, we've created a flexible, scalable, and extensible multimedia streaming application.

Explore the individual folders for a deeper understanding of each design pattern and its implementation.
