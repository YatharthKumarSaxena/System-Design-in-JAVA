The another observation I need to do here is that I know that this 
I know this streaming media player this needs to provide the support
for multiple mediaz so basically it is dealing with the collection 
of different medias so in order to solve this problem more streamline
more steamlessly what we need to hint we have to do do you know the 
good handling like how we handle the media the similarly you have to 
go and handle the you know the group or collection of the media right 
and to do this we again make use of the mostly
used structural day and pattern called as composite design pattern
