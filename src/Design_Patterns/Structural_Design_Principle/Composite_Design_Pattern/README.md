## 📂 [**Folder Structure**](#-folder-structure)

This folder consists of a total of **2 files**. Below is the detailed structure of the folder and its files:

### 📘 **Class Files (1)**
1️⃣ **Media_Collection.java** — Represents the collection of media files (audio, video, images) and provides a way to handle them together.

### 📘 **README File (1)**
2️⃣ **README.md** — The file you are currently reading, which explains the folder's structure and purpose.

## 📚 [**Insights of This Folder**](#-insights-of-this-folder)

This folder demonstrates one of the most useful and widely used **Structural Design Patterns** — the **Composite Design Pattern**.  
The **Composite Design Pattern** allows us to handle **groups of objects** and **individual objects** in a similar way, treating them uniformly.  
This pattern helps us manage **collections of media files** (like video, audio, and images) as if they were single objects.

## 🧐 [**What is the Composite Design Pattern?**](#-what-is-the-composite-design-pattern)

The **Composite Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a **group of objects** the same way you would treat a **single object**.  
This pattern is useful when you have objects that follow a **tree-like structure** where each node could be a leaf (individual object) or a composite (a group of objects).

### 🔍 **Real-Life Analogy**
Consider a **file system** where folders can contain both files and other folders.
- A **File** is like a "leaf node" that contains only data.
- A **Folder** can contain other files and folders.  
  With the **Composite Design Pattern**, you can perform actions like **delete**, **move**, or **copy** on both **files** and **folders** in the same way.

In our **Media Player** context, you can think of each **media file** (audio, video, image) as a "file" and a **collection of media** as a "folder" that can store individual media or even other collections.

## 💡 [**Where is the Composite Design Pattern Used in This Project?**](#-where-is-the-composite-design-pattern-used-in-this-project)

In this project, we want to create a **Media Collection** that allows users to play and manage **multiple media files** together.  
Instead of handling each media file (audio, video, image) individually, we want to be able to handle **a group of media files** as a single entity.

### **Challenge**
- We need a system to handle a **collection of media files** (audio, video, images) in a **tree-like structure**.
- This means we need to support both **individual media files** and **groups of media files**.
- Each media file (audio, video, image) should be treated as a "leaf node" in the tree.
- Collections of media files should act as "composite nodes" that can contain other media collections.

### **Solution**
- We use the **Composite Design Pattern** by creating a **Media_Collection** class.
- The **Media_Collection** can contain both individual media files (like audio, video, and images) and other **Media_Collection** objects.
- This allows us to handle **both individual media and groups of media** using the same methods.

## 🎉 [**Congratulations!**](#-congratulations)

You now have a complete understanding of the **Composite Design Pattern** and how it is used in this project.  
The key takeaway is that **Composite Pattern allows us to treat individual objects and groups of objects in a uniform way**.

If you have any questions, feel free to explore the **README.md** files in other folders for more guidance.

Happy Learning! 🚀🚀🚀
