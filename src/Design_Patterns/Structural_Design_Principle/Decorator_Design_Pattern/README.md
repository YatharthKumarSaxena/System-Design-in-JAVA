## 📂 **Folder Structure**

This folder consists of a total of **4 files**. Below is the detailed structure of the folder and its files:

### 📘 **Class Files (2)**
1️⃣ **HighQualityMediaDecorator.java** — Represents the decorator for high-quality media (video, audio, etc.).  
2️⃣ **Media_Decorator.java** — Represents the base decorator for media elements.      
3️⃣**LowQualityMediaDecorator.java** — Represents the decorator for low-quality media (video, audio, etc.).

### 📘 **README File (1)**
4️⃣ **README.md** — The file you are currently reading, which explains the folder's structure and purpose.

## 📚 **Insights of This Folder**

This folder demonstrates one of the most used **Structural Design Patterns** — the **Decorator Design Pattern**.  
This design pattern is useful when you want to **add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically** without modifying its structure.

---

## 🧐 **What is the Decorator Design Pattern?**

The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically attach new behaviors to an object without altering its structure.  
It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### 🔍 **Real-Life Analogy**
Consider a **media streaming platform** like **YouTube or Netflix**.  
Videos can be streamed in different **quality configurations** like **480p, 720p, or 1080p** depending on your internet speed.  
The **same video** can be decorated with different quality options, giving users the ability to choose the best option for their connection.  
This is exactly what the **Decorator Design Pattern** achieves.

## 💡 **Where is the Decorator Design Pattern Used in This Project?**

As per the **problem statement**, we aim to provide users with the ability to play media (audio, video, or images) in **different quality levels** (e.g., low, medium, high).  
To achieve this, we use the **Decorator Design Pattern**, which allows us to **dynamically add different quality levels** to the media content without changing the original structure.

### **Challenge**
- A media player must play **Audio**, **Video**, and **Images** in **multiple quality formats** (e.g., low, medium, high).
- But we don't want to create separate classes for each quality configuration, as that would make the design too rigid.

### **Solution**
- We use the **Decorator Design Pattern** by creating **Media_Decorator** and **HighQualityMediaDecorator** classes.
- The **Media_Decorator** serves as a base class for all other decorators.
- The **HighQualityMediaDecorator** adds new functionality to support higher-quality media.
- The **LowQualityMediaDecorator** adds new functionality to support low-quality media.

By doing this, we can **dynamically add or remove quality configurations** without touching the core logic of the media player.

## 🎉 **Congratulations!**
You now understand the purpose and structure of the **Decorator_Design_Pattern** folder.  
The key takeaway is that **Decorators dynamically add responsibilities to objects** without changing their structure.

If you have any questions, feel free to explore the **README.md** files in other folders for more guidance.

Happy Learning! 🚀🚀🚀
