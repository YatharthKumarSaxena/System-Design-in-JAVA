## 💡 What is Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to be selected at runtime based on the context.

### Key Components of the Strategy Pattern:
- **Context** 🧑‍💻: The object that maintains a reference to the Strategy and can switch between different strategies.
- **Strategy** 🧑‍💻: An interface or abstract class that defines a method for the algorithm.
- **Concrete Strategy** 🖥️: Implements the algorithm in a specific way.

By using the Strategy Pattern, you can allow an object to choose which algorithm to use, making it more flexible and reusable.

## 📝 Where is it Used in the Problem Statement?
In this project, the Strategy Design Pattern is applied to the Text Editor application. The goal is to apply different text formatting strategies (such as converting the text to uppercase or lowercase) dynamically, based on the user's input.

### How it's implemented:
- The **LowerCaseStrategy.java** 🖥️ and **UpperCaseStrategy.java** 🖥️ classes implement different text formatting strategies.
- The **TextFormattingStrategy.java** 🧑‍💻 interface defines the contract for text formatting, ensuring consistency across all strategies.

This pattern allows the text editor to switch between different formatting strategies without modifying its core functionality.

## 🚀 **Get Ready to Dive In!**
Explore the code and see how the Strategy Design Pattern makes it easy to implement multiple text formatting strategies and switch between them at runtime. This folder demonstrates how flexible the design can be when different formatting strategies are required.

Happy coding! 🎉
