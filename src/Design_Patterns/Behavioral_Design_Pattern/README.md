<h1>What is Behavioral Design Pattern</h1>
<h2>Define this pattern Jarvis in your own language</h2>
<h1>Why do we need behavioral design pattern </h1>
<h2>Everything that we do in the word of software development in the word of creation 
of the project is all inspired from the real word in the real word you will find the
real word entities interacting with each other they have some behaviour they react
the same thing I have to do in the word of programming I have some way to do this
very streamline manner and that's how the behavioural design pattern comes into the 
action day tell us that if we have to make our object interact if they have to define
the behaviour trip we have to see that how one object reacts based on the actions of
another object that's where the behaviour design pattern works this folder consist 
of the most used design patterns called as behavioural design pattern in this folder 
we understood how to implement the behaviour design pattern in the project by taking 
a small problem statement</h2>
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<h2>Develop a text editor application in Java date allows user to input text in applied 
different formatting styles example uppercase lowercase also there should be systems 
waiting for the text to be updated every time a text is updated the text editor 
should notify the observers also the text formatting operations should be encapsulated
and execute them on the editors text</h2>
