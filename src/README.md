## 🌟 **About This Repository** 🌟

<h2 style="color:#4CAF50;"> 📂 This repo contains <b>5 Mini JAVA Projects</b> 🛠️</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#2196F3;"> 🚀 Each project is built using concepts of <b>Low-Level Design (LLD)</b> 📐</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#FF9800;"> 💡 The primary language used is <b>JAVA</b> ☕</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#9C27B0;"> 🖥️ Projects were created using the <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> IDE 🔥</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#E91E63;"> 📘 This repo also strengthened my knowledge of <b>OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)</b> concepts in JAVA 📚</h2>
