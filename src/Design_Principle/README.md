# This folder is of Design Principles of Low Level Design 
# This folder consist of the most used and best design principle called SOLID Design Principle
# But why solid Design Principle , this is because this design principle consist of 5 Design Principles in itself
# 1.) S :- Single Responsibility Principle
# 2.) O :- Open Closed Principle
# 3.) L :- Liskov's Substitution Principle
# 4.) I :- Interface Segregation Principle
# 5.) D :- Dependency Inversion Principle
# To get understanding of how these Principles work , I took a different round
# Besides understanding it as raw learning that what is s , o , l etc. in SOLID
# I took a different round , I took a problem statement 
# Based on the problem statement , I build a mini project 
# And understood how SOLID Design Principles are implemented to make the code reusable , maintainable and scalable
# Please check out the Solid_Design_Principle folder
# Each folder consist of a readme.md file to assist you 
# This will also explain the key features of the file that in which file what principle of SOLID is followed
# However , that will be a summary
# To get detailed insights visit the files where these solid principles are actually implemented
# Comments are made in the class and interface files to understand how solid design principle actually worked in the project
