## 📂 **What's Inside This Folder?** 📂

This folder demonstrates the **SOLID Design Principles** using a practical, hands-on approach.  
Here's what you’ll find:
- 🔍 **Problem Statement** — A real-world problem is used as the foundation for the mini-project.
- 🏗️ **Mini Project** — A fully functional project where each SOLID principle is applied in the actual code.
- 📘 **README Files** — Each folder has its own `README.md` file to guide you through the principles applied in that specific folder.
- 📝 **Comments in Files** — Each class and interface file has **detailed comments** to explain which SOLID principle is used and how it works.

> **Note:** The files are interlinked, demonstrating how different classes, interfaces, and principles work together.

## 🔥 **Why SOLID Design Principles?** 🔥

**Why use the SOLID design principles?**  
Because it promotes **clean code** that's:
- 🛠️ **Reusable** — Build components that can be used in multiple projects.
- 🔧 **Maintainable** — Easily fix bugs and make changes without breaking the system.
- 📈 **Scalable** — Add new features and extend existing ones with minimal effort.

**But what does SOLID stand for?**  
It’s an acronym that represents **5 key design principles** for building flexible, maintainable, and robust systems.

## 📘 **The 5 SOLID Design Principles** 📘

| 🔥 **Letter** | 📘 **Principle**                | 📄 **Explanation**                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧱 **S**      | **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | A class should only have **one responsibility**. It should only have one reason to change.  |
| 🔒 **O**      | **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**         | **Open for extension**, but **closed for modification**. Add new functionality without altering existing code.  |
| 🔄 **L**      | **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** | Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. No unexpected behavior when replacing parent objects with child objects. |
| ✂️ **I**      | **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**| **Don’t force clients to implement unnecessary methods**. Interfaces should have specific, limited purposes. |
| 🔗 **D**      | **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**| Depend on **abstractions, not concrete implementations**. Th
