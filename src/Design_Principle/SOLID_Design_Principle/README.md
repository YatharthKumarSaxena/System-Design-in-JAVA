## 🏗️ **About This Project**

> 🚀 **Mini-Project:** **Library Management System** 🚀

This folder contains a comprehensive **Low-Level Design (LLD)** mini-project aimed at enhancing your design and coding skills. By following the **SOLID Design Principles**, this project demonstrates how to create a maintainable, scalable, and clean system design.

## 📚 **Problem Statement**

Design a **Library Management System** that handles different types of library items, such as:
- 📚 **Books**
- 💿 **CDs**
- 📀 **DVDs**

### 🔍 **Attributes of Each Item**
Every item in the system will have the following properties:
- 📌 **Title** — The name of the item.
- 📌 **Unique Identifier** — A unique ID for each item (like ISBN for books).
- 📌 **Type-specific Properties** — Different items have unique properties (e.g., **Author** for books, **Artist** for CDs, and **Director** for DVDs).

---

## 🔍 **System Features**

This system is equipped with the following essential features:

- ✅ **Check Out Items** — Users can borrow items from the library system.
- ✅ **Calculate Late Fees** — The system can compute late fees depending on the item type and the number of overdue days.
- ✅ **Calculate Total Value** — Determine the total value of all items available in the library.

Each feature showcases a practical implementation of **SOLID Design Principles** to ensure reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

## ✨ **How to Navigate This Folder**

To keep the project organized and intuitive, the folder is divided as follows:

1️⃣ **Main Project Folder** — Contains two essential subfolders.  
2️⃣ **Subfolder README Files** — Each subfolder includes its own **README.md** file that explains its contents and structure.

### 🔍 **What to Look For**
- 📁 **Folder Names** — Look for descriptive folder names to understand what each section covers.
- 📝 **README Files** — Every subfolder has a README file explaining how SOLID principles were applied.

This approach ensures smooth navigation and makes it easier to understand how the project is structured.
