## 💬 **What is System Design?**

System design is about planning the architecture and components of a system before implementing it. It's essentially about understanding the problem and figuring out how to build the solution with the best combination of technologies, components, and interaction.

# 🧩 **System Design Consists of Two Parts**

## 1. **High-Level Design**

**High-Level Design (HLD)** focuses on defining the structure of a system in a very abstract way, often used by senior developers and software architects. It provides a broad view of the system, covering the main components and how they interact.

### What is High-Level Design?

In simple terms, it’s a blueprint of the system architecture. Senior software developers and software architects use HLD to conceptualize the overall system.

## 🔧 **Steps in High-Level Design**

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**

- **Functional Requirements**: These are the features or functionalities that your customer needs. For example, a login system or a payment gateway.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: These define the quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, performance, security, and reliability. It’s about ensuring the system is fast, secure, and can handle growth.

### 2. **Prioritization**

This step involves breaking the project into phases and prioritizing tasks based on their importance or urgency. Critical features should be developed first to ensure they are implemented properly.

### 3. **Architecture Design**

At this stage, we define:
- The components of the system.
- The technologies to be used.
- The communication protocols and data flow.
- The infrastructure required for the system to work.

This is where we talk about both functional and non-functional aspects to ensure the system works as intended, both in terms of features and performance.

## 2. **Low-Level Design**

Low-Level Design (LLD) focuses on defining the implementation details of each component. This is where the actual coding, interaction, and class-level design take place, making it ideal for junior developers or freshers.

### What is Low-Level Design?

Low-Level Design is about detailing the components and their interactions. It’s more specific than high-level design and involves figuring out exactly how things will be done in terms of code, data structures, and class design.

---

### 🔧 **Steps in Low-Level Design**

- Detailed design of each component.
- Using **OOPS** principles to structure the design effectively.
- Applying the **SOLID principles** to ensure the design is scalable, maintainable, and flexible.
- Incorporating relevant **design patterns** to address common design problems.

By the end of this process, the system should be ready for actual implementation, where the design will guide the development of each component.
