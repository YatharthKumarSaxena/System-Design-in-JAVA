## 📝 **Detailed Explanation of Each File** 📝

### 🔍 **1️⃣ Library_Item (Interface)**
> **Concepts Applied:**
> - 🧱 **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
> - 🔐 **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
> - ✂️ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

#### 📘 **What This File Contains**
The **Library_Item** file is an **interface** that defines the structure for all library items.

#### 🛠️ **Why It Matters?**
- 🧱 **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** — The interface focuses only on defining the structure for library items, ensuring it has a clear, single responsibility.
- 🔐 **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** — New item types (like newspapers or magazines) can be added without modifying the **Library_Item** interface.
- ✂️ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** — The interface defines only essential methods, ensuring that child classes only implement what's relevant to them.

#### 💡 **Key Takeaway:**
The **Library_Item** interface promotes **openness for extension** (you can add new item types) while ensuring **closure for modification** (the interface remains unchanged).

### 🔍 **2️⃣ Books, 3️⃣ CD, 4️⃣ DVD (Class Files)**
> **Concepts Applied:**
> - 🔐 **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

#### 📘 **What These Files Contain**
These files — **Books**, **CD**, and **DVD** — are **concrete implementations** of the **Library_Item** interface. Each file contains specific logic related to the respective item type.

#### 🛠️ **Why It Matters?**
- 🔐 **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** — New items (like newspapers or e-books) can be added as new classes without modifying existing files.
- 💡 **Extensible Design** — You can create new item types by adding classes like **Newspaper** or **Magazine**, without touching the existing class logic.

#### 💡 **Key Takeaway:**
The classes **Books, CD, and DVD** embody the concept of **openness for extension** — new types of items can be added with ease — and **closure for modification**, as existing logic remains unchanged.

## 🔥 **Summary of SOLID Principles Used** 🔥

| 🔥 **SOLID Principle**         | 📄 **File**              | 📘 **Explanation**                                         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧱 **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | 📜 **Library_Item**     | The interface defines only the structure of library items, focusing on a single responsibility. |
| 🔐 **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**           | 📜 **Library_Item**, 📚 **Books**, 💿 **CD**, 📀 **DVD** | New item types (like newspapers or magazines) can be added as classes without modifying existing files. |
| ✂️ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  | 📜 **Library_Item**     | The interface defines only essential, item-specific methods, promoting a clean, focused design. |

> **Note:** The principles are applied to achieve maximum **reusability, maintainability, and extensibility** in the project.

## 🚀 **Why It Matters** 🚀

Adhering to **SOLID principles** in this folder provides numerous benefits:
- 🧹 **Clean Code** — Structured and readable files, easy to navigate.
- 🔄 **Reusability** — Code that can be reused and extended without rework.
- 🔧 **Maintainability** — Easily identify and fix bugs.
- 📈 **Scalability** — Adding new features or new item types is seamless.

By following these principles, you build a codebase that is future-proof and resilient to change.
