## 📂 Folder Structure
This folder contains the following items:

### Total Items: 5
- **Class Files**: 2 🖥️
- **Interface Files**: 2 🧑‍💻
- **README.md Files**: 1 📖 (The one you're reading)

### Breakdown of the Contents:

#### Class Files:
1. **TextConsoleObserver.java** 🖥️: Implements the logic for observing and handling updates from the text editor.
2. **TextEditor.java** 🧑‍💻: Represents the text editor, which produces the content that the observers react to.

#### Interface Files:
1. **TextEditorObserver.java** 🧑‍💻: Defines the contract for all observer classes, ensuring they can react to changes in the text editor.
2. **TextEditorSubject.java** 🖥️: Defines the contract for any class (like the text editor) that can be observed by other systems.

#### README.md File:
- **README.md** 📖: The current README.md file, providing a detailed explanation of this folder's structure and design pattern.

## 💡 What is Observer Design Pattern?
The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where one object (the **subject**) maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes to its state. This allows objects to be updated automatically when the state of another object changes, without the subject needing to know anything about the observers.

### Key Components of the Observer Pattern:
- **Subject** 🧑‍💻: The object that holds the state and notifies observers of changes. In this case, it's the **TextEditor**.
- **Observer** 🖥️: The objects that react to changes in the subject. Here, the **TextConsoleObserver** is an observer of the text editor.
- **Concrete Subject** 🧑‍💻: The class that implements the **Subject** interface and provides the update mechanism.
- **Concrete Observer** 🖥️: The class that implements the **Observer** interface and updates itself based on changes in the subject.

## 📝 Where is it Used in the Problem Statement?
In this project, the Observer Design Pattern is applied to a Text Editor application. The **TextEditor** is the subject, and both the **TextConsoleObserver** and **TextEditorObserver** act as observers.

### How it's implemented:
- The **TextEditor** 🧑‍💻 is responsible for creating and maintaining text. Other systems (observers) are registered to listen for changes in the text.
- The **TextConsoleObserver** 🖥️ reacts to changes and displays the updated text on the console.
- The **TextEditorObserver** 🖥️ listens for changes and performs specific actions (like printing the text) whenever the text is updated.

This setup allows for the decoupling of the text editor's functionality from the systems that observe and react to changes, making the design more flexible and scalable.

## 🚀 **Get Ready to Dive In!**
This folder demonstrates the Observer Design Pattern applied to a Text Editor project. Explore the code and see how changes in the text editor are observed and reacted to by other systems, providing a seamless integration.

Happy coding! 🎉
