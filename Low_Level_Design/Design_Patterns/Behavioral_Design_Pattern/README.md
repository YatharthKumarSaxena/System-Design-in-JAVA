## 🌐 **What is a Behavioral Design Pattern?**

> A **Behavioral Design Pattern** defines **how objects interact with each other** and how they communicate to achieve a goal.  
> These patterns focus on the **communication, coordination, and responsibilities** between objects, ensuring a smooth flow of information and behavior.

In simpler terms, when objects in our code need to interact with each other, they should do so in a systematic, streamlined, and maintainable way. Behavioral design patterns help to define and guide these interactions.

### 🚀 **Key Characteristics of Behavioral Design Patterns:**
- 📡 **Object Communication**: They define how objects send and receive information.
- 🔄 **Object Interaction**: They establish how objects react to changes in other objects.
- 🔍 **Behavior Encapsulation**: They hide the complexity of interactions, making the system more flexible.
- 🔗 **Loose Coupling**: Objects are less dependent on each other, making the system **scalable** and **maintainable**.

---

## ❓ **Why Do We Need Behavioral Design Patterns?**

> **"Everything we do in the world of software development is inspired by the real world."**

Imagine real-world interactions:
- A **teacher and a student** — The teacher influences the student's behavior.
- A **remote control and a TV** — The remote sends commands to the TV to change channels, volume, etc.
- A **news agency and subscribers** — When news is updated, all subscribers are notified.

In programming, similar scenarios exist where one object reacts to changes or commands from another. **Behavioral Design Patterns** help achieve these types of interactions in a **streamlined, controlled, and maintainable manner**.

### 🌐 **Why Are They Important?**
1. **Interaction of Objects** — They define clear, consistent ways for objects to communicate.
2. **Reacting to Changes** — Objects can react to changes in other objects, much like subscribers react to breaking news.
3. **Loose Coupling** — By decoupling objects, you ensure they can change independently, which is crucial for **scalability** and **maintenance**.
4. **Predictable Behavior** — Instead of random interactions, objects follow well-defined rules.

## 🧑‍💻 **Problem Statement**

> **Develop a Text Editor application in Java.**

The Text Editor should allow users to:
1. **Input Text** — Users can enter any text into the editor.
2. **Apply Text Formatting** — Users can format the text, for example:
    - 🆙 **Convert text to uppercase**
    - 🔡 **Convert text to lowercase**
3. **Notify Observers** — Any time the text is updated, all registered observers should be **notified** automatically.
4. **Encapsulate Text Formatting Operations** — Each formatting operation (like uppercase, lowercase) should be encapsulated so it can be executed on the text in the editor.

---

### 🔥 **How Do the Design Patterns Fit Here?**

1. **Observer Design Pattern**
    - **Use Case:** Observers (like external logs or UI notifications) are notified when the text is updated.
    - **Example:** When you type text, all observers (like a live preview) are updated.

2. **Command Design Pattern**
    - **Use Case:** Encapsulating the commands for **Uppercase** and **Lowercase** actions.
    - **Example:** Each button click (like "Uppercase" or "Lowercase") runs a **Command**.

3. **Strategy Design Pattern**
    - **Use Case:** Choose which text formatting strategy (like uppercase or lowercase) to apply.
    - **Example:** Switch between different text formatting strategies **dynamically**.

## 🎉 **Final Takeaway**

> **"Interacting objects are at the heart of every system."**

Behavioral Design Patterns allow us to manage these object interactions in a clean, maintainable, and scalable way. Here's a recap of the key points:

1. **What are Behavioral Design Patterns?**
    - Patterns that define how objects communicate with each other in a system.

2. **Why do we need them?**
    - To build software systems where objects interact in a systematic, clean, and controlled way.

3. **Problem Statement?**
    - We created a **Text Editor** app that allows text editing, formatting, and observer notifications using the **Command, Observer, and Strategy** design patterns.

4. **Core Design Patterns Used:**
    - **Observer Pattern** — Notify observers when the text is updated.
    - **Command Pattern** — Encapsulate formatting commands like Uppercase, Lowercase, etc.
    - **Strategy Pattern** — Dynamically switch between formatting strategies.
