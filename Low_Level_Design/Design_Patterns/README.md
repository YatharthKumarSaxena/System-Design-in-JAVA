## 📂 **Folder Structure**

This folder contains **3 main folders** and **1 README.md file**.  
Here’s the breakdown of the folder structure:

- 📁 **Behavioral_Design_Pattern** (Folder) — Contains examples of behavioral design patterns that define how objects interact with each other.
- 📁 **Creational_Design_Pattern** (Folder) — Focuses on object creation mechanisms, making object creation more flexible and reusable.
- 📁 **Structural_Design_Pattern** (Folder) — Demonstrates how objects and classes can be combined to form larger, more complex structures.
- 📘 **README.md** — The file you're currently reading!

> Each folder contains a dedicated **README.md** file that explains the design patterns applied within that folder, along with class files and problem statements.

## 📂 **What's Inside This Folder?**

This folder demonstrates the **Design Patterns** using a practical, hands-on approach.  
Here's what you’ll find:
- 🔍 **Problem Statement** — A real-world problem is used as the foundation for the mini-project.
- 🏗️ **Mini Project** — A fully functional project where each specific design pattern is applied in the actual code.
- 📘 **README Files** — Each folder has its own `README.md` file to guide you through the design patterns applied in that specific folder.
- 📝 **Comments in Files** — Each class and interface file contains **detailed comments** to explain which design pattern is used and how it works.

> **Note:** The files are interlinked, demonstrating how different classes, interfaces, and principles work together.

## 💡 **What is a Design Pattern?**

If design principles are the "wisdom" passed down by experienced developers, then **design patterns are the practical implementations of that wisdom**.

When developers face recurring problems while building software, they document the **best solution** that worked for them.  
Over time, these "proven solutions" became what we now know as **design patterns**.

To put it simply:
- 🛠️ **Design Patterns are like blueprints** — reusable, time-tested templates for solving specific problems in software design.
- ⚙️ **They are not exact code** — Instead, they provide you with a clear strategy to solve similar problems in your own projects.

By using design patterns, you avoid "reinventing the wheel" and follow best practices that have already been tested by industry experts.

## 🔥 **Why Design Patterns?**

Why should you care about **Design Patterns**?  
Because they promote **reusability, maintainability, and flexibility** in your code.

Here’s why you should adopt design patterns:
- 🛠️ **Reusable Solutions** — Write a solution once and use it multiple times.
- 🔧 **Easy to Maintain** — Changes affect only specific components, not the entire system.
- 📈 **Scalability** — Easily extend features without rewriting large portions of code.
- 🔍 **Clarity in Design** — Design patterns make your system's structure clear to other developers.

Instead of struggling to find the right approach to a problem, you can follow well-documented design patterns that are already **proven to work**.

## 📘 **The 3 Types of Design Patterns**

There are **3 main types of design patterns**, each with a specific purpose. Here’s a quick breakdown:

| 📂 **Category**         | 📘 **What It Does**                            | 🛠️ **Example Patterns**                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 📁 **Creational**       | Focuses on object creation. Ensures flexibility and efficiency when creating objects. | **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Builder**  |
| 📁 **Structural**       | Deals with object composition. Helps create large, flexible structures. | **Adapter**, **Composite**, **Facade**  |
| 📁 **Behavioral**       | Focuses on communication between objects. Ensures clear and effective interactions. | **Observer**, **Strategy**, **Command**  |

### 🔍 **1. Creational Design Patterns**
Creational patterns focus on **how objects are created**. They provide flexibility and control in how objects are instantiated.
> **Example Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory

### 🔍 **2. Structural Design Patterns**
Structural patterns focus on **how classes and objects are organized** to form larger, more complex structures.
> **Example Patterns:** Adapter, Composite, Facade, Proxy, Flyweight, Bridge

### 🔍 **3. Behavioral Design Patterns**
Behavioral patterns focus on **communication between objects** and how they interact with each other.
> **Example Patterns:** Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, State

These three categories cover every aspect of how objects are created, structured, and interact with one another. Mastering these design patterns will significantly improve the quality of your software development.

## 🎉 **Final Takeaway**

Design patterns are a powerful way to solve **common software design problems**.  
They are like **pre-built templates** for how to approach issues related to **object creation, structure, and communication**.

By following these patterns, you can:
- ✅ **Build better software** — Code is more structured, reusable, and flexible.
- ✅ **Save time** — No need to "reinvent the wheel." Proven solutions already exist.
- ✅ **Collaborate effectively** — Other developers can easily understand your design decisions.

📘 **Key Insight:**  
Mastering **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns** will make you a more skilled, professional, and effective developer.

🚀 **Happy Coding!** 🚀
