## 📂 **Folder Structure**

This folder consists of a total of **6 files**. Below is the detailed structure of the folder and its files:

### 📘 **Class Files (4)**
1️⃣ **Audio.java** — Represents the Audio file entity.  
2️⃣ **Image.java** — Represents the Image file entity.  
3️⃣ **Image_Adapter.java** — The **Adapter** file that helps the Image class adapt to the media player.  
4️⃣ **Video.java** — Represents the Video file entity.

### 📘 **Interface File (1)**
5️⃣ **Media.java** — An interface implemented by the **Audio**, **Image_Adapter**, and **Video** classes, ensuring compatibility with the media player.

### 📘 **README File (1)**
6️⃣ **README.md** — The file you are currently reading, which explains the folder's structure and purpose.

## 📚 **Insights of This Folder**

This folder demonstrates one of the most used **Structural Design Patterns** — the **Adapter Design Pattern**.  
This design pattern is useful when you want to **bridge two incompatible interfaces** and ensure that they work together seamlessly.

---

## 🧐 **What is the Adapter Design Pattern?**

The **Adapter Design Pattern** allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.  
It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, enabling them to collaborate without changing their existing structures.

### 🔍 **Real-Life Analogy**
Imagine you have a **3-pin plug** but only a **2-pin socket** available.  
You'd use an **adapter** that allows the 3-pin plug to connect to the 2-pin socket.  
This real-life concept is the same as the software **Adapter Design Pattern**.

## 💡 **Where is the Adapter Design Pattern Used in This Project?**

In this project, we want to create a **Media Player** that can play **Audio** and **Video**, and **Images**.  
However, there is a problem — the **Image** class is incompatible with the Media Player's expected behavior.  
To solve this, we create an **Adapter** class called **Image_Adapter** that helps the **Image** class adapt to the Media Player's interface.

---

## ⚙️ **How Does It Work?**

1️⃣ We have a **Media** interface, which defines a `play()` method.  
2️⃣ The **Audio** and **Video** classes implement the **Media** interface, so they are directly compatible with the Media Player.  
3️⃣ The **Image** class, however, does not follow this structure, so it **cannot be played** directly.  
4️⃣ To bridge this gap, we introduce an **Adapter** — the **Image_Adapter** class.  
5️⃣ The **Image_Adapter** takes an **Image** object and makes it **compatible** with the Media Player.

---

## 🔥 **Why Use the Adapter Design Pattern?**

1️⃣ **Bridge the Gap** — It allows incompatible interfaces (like Image and Media) to work together.  
2️⃣ **Increases Flexibility** — We can add new, incompatible file types without changing the Media Player.  
3️⃣ **Enhances Reusability** — You can reuse existing incompatible classes without modifying them.  
4️⃣ **Reduces Complexity** — The adapter hides the complexity of transforming one interface into another.

## 📘 **Problem Statement**

> **"We are developing a multimedia streaming application that supports various types of media,  
> including videos, audio tracks, and images. The application needs to handle different media formats,  
> provide efficient storage, and enable seamless playback for users."**

### **Challenge**
- The Media Player should be able to play **Audio**, **Video**, and **Images** using the same `play()` method.
- But **Image** does not fit into the existing Media structure.

### **Solution**
- We use the **Adapter Design Pattern** by creating an **Image_Adapter**.
- The **Image_Adapter** ensures that the **Image** class conforms to the **Media** interface, allowing the Media Player to play Images just like Videos and Audio.

## 🎉 **Congratulations!**
You now understand the purpose and structure of the **Adapter_Design_Pattern** folder.  
The key takeaway is that **Adapters bridge the gap between incompatible interfaces**.

If you have any questions, feel free to explore the **README.md** files in other folders for more guidance.

Happy Learning! 🚀🚀🚀
