## 📂 **Folder Structure**

This repository consists of **3 main folders**:
- **Design_Pattern** (Contains implementation of various design patterns in JAVA)
- **Design_Principle** (Covers fundamental design principles applied to solve problems)
- **Mini_Projects** (Contains individual mini projects demonstrating LLD concepts in practice)

### **Breakdown of the Folder Structure**:
1. **📁 Design_Pattern**
    - **Number of Files:** X files
    - **README.md** — Overview of design patterns used.
    - **Class Files** — Implementations of various design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).

2. **📁 Design_Principle**
    - **Number of Files:** X files
    - **README.md** — Explanation of design principles (SOLID, DRY, etc.).
    - **Class Files** — Examples of applying design principles.

3. **📁 Mini_Projects**
    - **Number of Files:** X files
    - **README.md** — Detailed description of each mini project, including objectives and implementation details.
    - **Class Files** — Each project contains a set of classes to demonstrate specific LLD concepts.

4. **📄 README.md** — The file you're currently reading!

## 🌟 **About This Repository**

<h2 style="color:#4CAF50;"> 📂 This repo contains <b>6 Mini JAVA Projects</b> 🛠️</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#2196F3;"> 🚀 Each project is built using concepts of <b>Low-Level Design (LLD)</b> 📐</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#FF9800;"> 💡 The primary language used is <b>JAVA</b> ☕</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#9C27B0;"> 🖥️ Projects were created using the <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> IDE 🔥</h2>  
<h2 style="color:#E91E63;"> 📘 This repo also strengthened my knowledge of <b>OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)</b> concepts in JAVA 📚</h2>

## 🛠️ **What's Inside?**

> **This repository is a collection of 6 mini projects** that demonstrate the application of **Low-Level Design (LLD) principles** in **JAVA**. These projects are designed to enhance understanding of key programming concepts, especially in OOPs.

### 📝 **Key Highlights of Each Project**
- ✅ **1 Project** is based on problem statements that require the use of specific **Design Principles** (SOLID principles).
- ✅ **3 Projects** illustrate the implementation of three distinct **Design Patterns**.
- ✅ **2 Projects** (found in the Mini_Projects folder) demonstrate the **combined use of all design principles and design patterns used in DESIGN_PRINCIPLE and DESIGN_PATTERN folder**.
- ✅ Each project follows clean code principles, with a focus on **reusability, maintainability, and scalability**.

## 🚀 **Why This Repository Stands Out**

🎉 **6 Mini Projects in One Repo** — Learn, practice, and master LLD concepts!  
🔧 **1 Project Focused on Design Principles** — Master the SOLID principles with hands-on examples.  
📘 **3 Design Pattern Projects** — Gain practical knowledge of key design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.  
📂 **2 Advanced Projects** — Witness the combined application of design principles and design patterns.  
📘 **OOPs Concepts** — Strengthen your understanding of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.  
☕ **Core JAVA** — Dive into one of the most widely used programming languages!  
💻 **IntelliJ IDEA** — Projects are crafted using this powerful development environment.
