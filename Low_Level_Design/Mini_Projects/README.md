## 📘 **What's Inside This Folder?**

This folder demonstrates the practical application of **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts. Each project focuses on implementing **SOLID Design Principles** and utilizes various **Design Patterns** to build scalable, maintainable, and reusable systems.

Here’s a sneak peek at what’s inside each folder:

1. **📁 Car_Parking_Lot_Project**
    - 🛠️ **Objective**: Implement a car parking system that follows the SOLID design principles.
    - 📘 **Design Patterns Used**: Includes patterns like Creational, Behavioral, and Structural Design Patterns (wherever applicable).
    - 📑 **README.md**: Provides in-depth details about the project, its objectives, folder structure, and more.

2. **📁 Vehicle_Renting_System_Project**
    - 🛠️ **Objective**: Build a vehicle renting system where users can rent various types of vehicles.
    - 📘 **Design Patterns Used**: Uses design patterns like Creational, Behavioral, and Structural Pattern (where applicable).
    - 📑 **README.md**: Contains a comprehensive overview of the system, its folder structure, and key concepts applied.

> Each project in this folder focuses on **SOLID principles** and demonstrates the usage of various design patterns from the **Design_Patterns** and **Design_Principles** folders.

## 🌟 **Purpose of This Folder**

The **Mini_Projects** folder serves as a practical playground where key concepts of **Low-Level Design (LLD)** are applied in real-world scenarios. Each project in this folder:

- 🛠️ **Implements the 5 SOLID Design Principles** to make the project modular, maintainable, and extendable.
- 🧱 **Applies the Design Patterns** learned from the **Design_Patterns** folder.
- 📘 **Demonstrates Practical Use Cases** for OOPs concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
- 💡 **Enhances Problem-Solving Skills** by solving real-world problems using design principles and patterns.

These projects help strengthen your knowledge of **LLD**, **OOPs**, and **Design Principles**, making you more skilled at tackling larger, real-world software development projects.

## 🎉 **Final Takeaway**

The **Mini_Projects** folder is your chance to see how **SOLID principles** and **design patterns** are applied in real-world applications. With two comprehensive projects — **Car_Parking_Lot_Project** and **Vehicle_Renting_System_Project** — you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to build scalable, maintainable, and clean software systems.

Each project is carefully crafted to demonstrate best practices in **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**. By studying these mini-projects, you'll master concepts that will prepare you for larger software development challenges.

🚀 **Happy Learning & Coding!** 🚀
