## 📖 **Introduction**
The `Parking Lot Elements` folder is an essential part of the Parking Lot System Project. It encapsulates the foundational components of the system, ensuring modularity and maintainability. This folder primarily contains interfaces and classes that implement the core logic for managing parking areas, slots, and addresses.

## 📂 **Folder Structure**
This folder contains a total of **6 files**:

- **🖼️ Interface Files:**
    1. `Parking_Area` 📋: Defines methods for managing parking areas, including slot count and address retrieval.
    2. `Parking_Slot` 📋: Outlines methods for managing individual parking slots, such as their status and type.
    3. `Address` 📋: Specifies methods to access address details like place, city, and country.

- **🏗️ Class Files:**
    4. `Address_Of_Parking_Area` 🏠: Implements the `Address` interface, managing address details of a parking area.
    5. `Area` 🏢: Implements the `Parking_Area` interface, handling collections of parking slots and their statuses.
    6. `Slot` 🚗: Implements the `Parking_Slot` interface, managing individual parking slot statuses and types.

- **📄 README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the folder’s contents and purpose.

## 📜 **Key Highlights**
### 1. **Adherence to Design Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
    - The `Address_Of_Parking_Area` class is solely responsible for managing address details.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
    - The `Area` class works seamlessly with any implementation of the `Parking_Slot` and `Address` interfaces, ensuring substitutability.

### 2. **Use of Design Patterns:**
- **Composite Design Pattern:**
    - The `Area` class treats a collection of parking slots as a single entity, simplifying management and calculations.

### 3. **Static Member Initialization:**
- Static variables, such as `Address_ID`, `Area_ID`, and `Slot_ID`, are initialized in static blocks to ensure proper sequence and unique identification.

### 4. **Interface Implementation:**
- Interfaces are used to enforce contracts, ensuring that all classes adhere to a standard structure and behavior.

### 5. **Code Modularity:**
- Each component has a dedicated class or interface, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**
This folder demonstrates the effective application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to build a robust and scalable Parking Lot System. By breaking down responsibilities and adhering to best practices, the components ensure flexibility and ease of future enhancements.
