## ðŸ“– **Introduction**
This folder contains the implementation of the Gate System for the Parking Lot Project. The Gate System is designed using core Object-Oriented Principles and Design Patterns, ensuring modularity and scalability. The primary focus is on **Entry Gates** and **Exit Gates**, each having unique functionalities tailored for efficient parking management.

The following concepts are implemented in this module:
- **Design Principles**:
    - **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)**: Separate interfaces for entry and exit gates.
    - **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**: High-level modules depend on abstractions.
    - **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Clear segregation of responsibilities for entry and exit gates.
    - **DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)**: Common functionality encapsulated in shared interfaces.
- **Design Pattern**:
    - **Template Design Pattern**: Interfaces define a structure/template that concrete classes implement.

## ðŸ“‚ **Folder Structure**
This folder consists of a total of six files:

- ðŸ“œ `Gate.java`: Defines the common functionalities for all gates, acting as a template.
- ðŸ“œ `Entry_Gate_Interface.java`: Extends the `Gate` interface and includes functionalities specific to entry gates, such as ticket generation.
- ðŸ“œ `Exit_Gate_Interface.java`: Extends the `Gate` interface and includes functionalities specific to exit gates, such as bill generation.
- ðŸ“„ `GateFactory.java`: Implements a factory pattern to create instances of `Entry_Gate` and `Exit_Gate` based on the required parking area.
- ðŸ“„ `Entry_Gate.java`: Implements the `Entry_Gate_Interface`, handling functionalities like ticket generation and gate identification.
- ðŸ“„ `Exit_Gate.java`: Implements the `Exit_Gate_Interface`, managing functionalities like bill generation and resetting parking slot status.
- ðŸ“– `README.md`: Provides an overview of this folder's purpose, structure, and concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Final Takeaway**
- The **Gate System** demonstrates the effective use of OOP principles and design patterns to achieve modularity and maintainability.
- The **Template Design Pattern** ensures consistency across entry and exit gate functionalities, while adhering to **DRY** and **SRP** principles.
- The **ISP and DIP principles** enable flexible and scalable designs by segregating responsibilities and promoting abstraction.

With this module, the Parking Lot Project achieves an efficient and extensible system for managing entry and exit gates, contributing to the overall robustness of the solution.
