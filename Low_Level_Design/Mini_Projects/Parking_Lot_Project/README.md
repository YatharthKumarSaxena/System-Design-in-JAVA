## 📖 **Introduction**

The **Parking Lot Project** is a comprehensive implementation of a parking management system designed to efficiently manage vehicles, parking slots, and user interactions. Built with **Java** and following object-oriented design principles, it showcases the integration of **design patterns** for scalability and maintainability.

This project is modeled for an **individual company** and handles complex scenarios like slot allocation, ticket generation, billing, and user management.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

1. **Vehicle Management**:
    - Creation of vehicles using the **Factory Design Pattern**.
    - Supported types: Bike, Car, Auto.

2. **Parking Area Management**:
    - Areas and slots managed as a **Composite** entity.
    - Efficient allocation and tracking of slots.

3. **Gate System**:
    - Separate entry and exit gates with unique IDs.
    - Automated ticket generation and bill calculation.

4. **User Interaction**:
    - Differentiation between employees and customers.
    - Employees have reserved slots; customers are assigned based on availability.

5. **System Metrics**:
    - Track total, filled, and empty slots dynamically.
    - Company rating system for feedback.

## 📚 **Design Principles and Patterns**

This project incorporates several **design principles** and **patterns** for an optimal and scalable solution:

### 🧩 Design Principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class handles a single responsibility.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: New parking area types can be seamlessly integrated without modifying existing functionality.

### 🛠️ Design Patterns:
1. **Singleton**:
    - Used for managing a single instance of the parking lot company.

2. **Factory**:
    - Applied for vehicle and gate creation to encapsulate object instantiation.

3. **Composite**:
    - Treats parking areas as a single entity while allowing varied slot configurations.

## 🎯 **Final Takeaway**

The **Parking Lot Project** is not just a demonstration of technical prowess but also a practical application of **design principles** and **patterns**. It underscores the importance of a structured approach in solving real-world problems and highlights the potential of Java for developing robust systems.

With this project, I honed my skills in **system design**, **Java programming**, and **object-oriented principles**, laying a strong foundation for future endeavors. 🌟
